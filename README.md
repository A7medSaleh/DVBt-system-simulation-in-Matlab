In this code I build and simulate the DVB-t wireless communication system on matlab. It is mainly used in digital TV broadcasting. Any communication system is formed of three main components: a transmitter, a channel and a receiver. The information source sends the message signal which holds the information of either an input image from user or a random source, via the transmitter and the signal is conducted to a receiver via a channel where it can be overlapped with noise. The signal is received and fed to the user as output image. The transmitter is mainly a cascade of a source encoder, a channel encoder and a modulator while the receiver is a cascade of a demodulator, a channel decoder and a source decoder. The purpose of this project is to simulate the basic components of a digital DVBt communication system using MATLAB programming. A PSK modulator and a corresponding receiver are simulated along with burst error effect from channel.


Also with the code files you will find a detailed schenatics showing the components and steps of both transmitter and reciever.
